# Client side certificate stuff

Client side Javascript code for handle PKCS#10 and PKCS#12 stuff

# Why not PeculiarVentures PKI.js?

PKI.js creates PKCS#12 files accounding to PKCS#12, but browsers OpenSSL and
other subjects are not able to open that flavour of PKCS#12. We are
investigating that, but be have no influence of what Mozilla, PeculiarVentures
etc. are doing. So far we use digitalbazaars forge, even it still does not
support ECDSA, but their PKCS#12 are accepted by most libraries.
